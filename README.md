# LocoTrivia

This is a javascript wrapper for [loco trivia](https://getloconow.com). This is still in development and new features will be added over time.

## Installation

`yarn add locotrivia` or `npm i locotrivia`

## Getting Started

To use this wrapper you will need an authentication token. This can be aquired by sniffing the loco app web trafic using a proxy tool such as [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/). Use the smaller authentication token, not the larger one. It will look something like `Bearer j9a347Tdsagjdjshgw8bqCC6jZn53st46Ty`. Once you have the authentication token you can create a new instance of the Loco class by doing  

```js

import Loco from 'locotrivia'; // or const Loco = require('locotrivia');
const loco = new Loco('auth token');

```

**If you are using require (es5) you need to do `const loco = new Loco.default('auth token')`**

### Websocket Example

## ~~**NOTE** ws() is currently broken. The below code will not work at this time~~ IT MIGHT BE FIXED IDK

```js

import Loco from 'locotrivia'; // or const Loco = require('locotrivia');
import WebSocket from 'ws'; // or const WebSocket = require('ws');

const loco = new Loco('auth token');

loco.getShows().then((shows) => {
  if (shows.active) {
    const ws = loco.ws();
    ws.onmessage = (msg) => {
      const json = JSON.parse(msg.data);
      console.log(json);
    };
    // locotrivia handles .on('open') or .onopen for you
  } else console.log('Loco is not live.');
});

```
